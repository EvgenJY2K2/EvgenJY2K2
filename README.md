👋 Hello, I’m @EvgenJY2K2

⭐ I am a STEM enthusiast, and a passionate programmer. On my way to obtaining a Mechanical Engineering degree minoring in Software Engineering at LUT University, Finland.

🌱 Currently involved in mentoring for Google Developer Student Clubs, teaching exercise groups on mechanics and programming courses, creating content for LUT Entrepreneurship Society, and completing a "Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization" course from the University of California San Diego.

🚀 Most recently I completed a Professional Data Analytics Certificate from Google and analyzed a real-life company (find more details in my GitHub/Kaggle profile)!
