👋 Hello, I’m @EvgenJY2K2

⭐ I am a STEM enthusiast, and passionate programmer, on my way to obtaining a Mechanical Engineering degree minoring in Software Engineering.

🚀 Most recently I completed a Scientific Computing with Python course and Professional Data Analytics Certificate from Google (analyzed a real-life company - check it out in my profile).
